<h1>Help: Ratings</h1>

<p>All posts on imeji are one of three ratings: SFW, Sketchy and NSFW.
  Sketchy is the default if you don't specify one. </p>


<div class="card">
    <h4>SFW : Safe For Work</h4>
    <p>Safe posts are images that you would not feel guilty looking at openly in public.
      Pictures of nudes, exposed nipples or pubic hair, cameltoe, or any sort of sexually suggestive pose are NOT safe and belong in Sketchy.
      Swimsuits and lingerie are borderline cases; some are SFW, some are Sketchy.</p>
  </div>

<div class="card">
    <h4>Sketchy</h4>
    <p>Basically anything that isn't safe for work or not. This is the great middle area, and since it includes unrated posts, you shouldn't really expect anything one way or the other when browsing questionable posts.</p>
</div>


<div class="card">
  <h4>NSFW : Not Safe For Work</h4>
  <p>Any image where the vagina or penis are exposed and easily visible. This includes depictions of sex, masturbation, or any sort of penetration.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h4>Search</h4>
    <p>You can filter search results by querying for <code>rating:sfw</code>, <code>rating:sketchy</code>, or <code>rating:nsfw</code> for safe, questionable, and explicit posts, respectively. You can also combine them with other tags and they work as expected.</p>
    <p>If you want to remove a rating from your search results, use <code>-rating:sfw</code>, <code>-rating:sketchy</code>, and <code>-rating:nsfw</code>.</p>
